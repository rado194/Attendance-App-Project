# Attendance-Project

Ruby based MVC project to create an interactive student attendance register

This project was assigned to a team of 6 students in the duration of one week. It involved the creation of a web-based attendance app, where our tutor can view all of our courses and students in the Academy, as well as having the options to edit attendances and edit students and courses. 

The team approached the project with the MVC pattern and Agile and Scrum methods by diving the tasks to core and optional. The team used a number of sprints every day, allocated different core tasks to small numbers of groups and going through reviewing after each task was completed. The project team collaborated using GitHub and creating a master branch as well as a number of separated branches allowing the tasks to be divided. The team successfully produced the product which met the required expectations and was presented at the end of the week. 


Radoslav contributed with creating some of the controllers, styling of the website and the functionality on some of the pages. 

Technologies Used: Ruby on rails, GitHub, Agile, Scrum, JavaScript, CSS, Sinatra
